							<h3>Quantum for AI</h3>
							<h2>What is it?</h2>
							<h3>Using quantum computers to accelerate the efficiency and growth of AI in business and society</h3>
							<p>AI has advanced substantially in recent years thanks in part to an explosion
of data. But AI’s potential has been hampered in areas where classical computers are of limited use, like chemistry. We think quantum computers can help. They’re powered by qubits, which use a fundamentally different set of instructions than classical machines, and can run different types of algorithms. These algorithms exploit quantum effects like non-locality, entanglement, superposition, and interference to solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical machines. Some day, when universal quantum computers contain thousands or millions of qubits, it may be possible to load massive data sets into the machines and create a rich environment for AI to calculate problems currently beyond the realm of consideration. In the short term, we imagine hybrid systems that pair classical computers with a small quantum co-processor to increase the speed of performing certain tasks and to eliminate the bottlenecks in AI’s growth.</p>

							<h3>Using machine learning to detect the presence of psychiatric disorders</h3>
							<p>As with many afflictions, early treatment of psychiatric disorders tends to improve outcomes, but diagnosis can be nontrivial, especially with schizophrenia, and is based on subjective assesments rather than on objective measurements. There
is no reliable objective test, and spotting differences in brain images is often impossible even for experts. But we think AI can help. In collaboration with the University of Alberta, we used AI and machine learning algorithms to identify statistical biomarkers, abnormalities in the brain’s functional networks, and detect instances of schizophrenia in a series of fMRI images with 74 percent accuracy.
The research also shows a new capability
to predict the severity of specific symptoms
in patients. We believe AI and machine learning can usher in an era of computational psychiatry to help clinicians assess, and therefore treat, schizophrenia. This groundbreaking work also has potential to help create new avenues and techniques to diagnose and treat other psychiatric disorders, from depression to PTSD.”</p>

							<h3>IBM Debating Technology</h3>
							<h2>What is it?</h2>
							<h3>Using AI to create persuasive arguments about thorny issues</h3>
							<p>IBM Debating Technology is an AI-powered decision-making research project that absorbs massive data sets and perspectives to address questions that have no clear answer. It uses natural language processing, machine learning, and knowledge graphs to construct persuasive arguments about complex issues. For example, “Would stricter gun control laws diminish mass killings?” or “Should I become
a vegetarian?” Unlike search engines, Debating Technology doesn’t reply to a query with a list of documents to read. It absorbs a corpus of data to identify compelling arguments covering various aspects of an issue. This requires the both the ability to understand the nuances of natural language and to extract powerful evidence from billions of candidates. Big issues are rarely black and white. In this project, we’re exploring using artificial reasoning
to create a passionate viewpoint
while dispassionately explaining the other side of the argument. It has the potential to become a powerful ally
to anyone faced with making urgent decisions. We imagine a tool with broad applicability in policy and business. It could even help find the clearest path forward in a user’s life and career.

							<h3>Moments in Time Dataset</h3>
							<h2>What is it?</h2>
							<h3>Building a large-scale data set for recognizing action in videos</h3>
							<p>A lot can happen in a moment: A girl kicks a ball in front of a woman walking a dog while a man reads his book
on a bench and birds fly overhead. Humans routinely absorb and process the details of such moments and can effortlessly describe objects (girl, ball, birds, book), setting (park) and actions (kicking, walking, reading, flying).
But it’s not so easy for computers. Computer vision researchers have made great strides in image recognition recently thanks to breakthroughs in deep learning, increases in computing power, and the creation of massive labeled datasets – namely ImageNet and Places. We want to do the same for action recognition. As part of our MIT IBM Watson AI Lab, we developed the Moments in Time Dataset, a large-scale dataset containing 1 million 3-second video snippets manually labeled according to the actions they contain.
It includes 339 activities, many of which are performed by various actors.
For example, people opening doors
and books. Dogs opening their mouths. Flowers opening petals. We believe
the Dataset will spawn an array of applications in healthcare, automotive, entertainment, foster new research, and help to further unlock the promise of AI.</p>

							<h3>MLModelScope</h3>
							<h2>What is it?</h2>
							<h3>A one-stop shop to test machine learning and deep learning models and software</h3>
							<p>New open-source machine learning
and deep learning models, frameworks, platforms, and hardware system accelerators are cropping up almost every day. These resources can greatly spur innovation – if they can be easily tested and compared. It’s often necessary to follow many pages of documentation to install one ML or DL framework. Then there’s the arduous process required to download and use a particular model – and the complexity of navigating hardware con gurations and software installations and dependencies. As part of AI Horizons Network, we’ve created MLModelScope to simplify this process together with
our colleagues from University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. It’s an open-
source platform built to spur innovation
by enabling developers, builders, and users to quickly find, test, deploy, and benchmark combinations of models, frameworks, and hardware con gurations. It makes it easier to publish and evaluate ML/DL models and experiment with existing models and frameworks. IT architects can benchmark system resource utilization to improve operating ef ciency. Hardware builders can understand system bottlenecks to improve designs.</p>

							<h3>Watson Discovery Visual Insight</h3>
							<h2>What is it?</h2>
							<h3>Finding the big picture in billions of pictures</h3>
							<p>Every day billions of videos and images are uploaded to the top five social media sites alone. This massive data flow contains invaluable insights for anyone trying to understand customer sentiment, competitor activity, the efficacy of advertising campaigns, or trends in
the marketplace. Of course the trick is identifying signals in all that visual noise. That’s where Watson Discovery Visual Insight comes in. Visual Insight is built on Watson Discovery Service, which finds patterns in massive amounts of data, whether public or private, structured or unstructured. Discovery uses natural language processing to ingest and normalize data into a common format and sentiment analysis and concept tagging to enrich and index it. Visual Insight takes that process to imagery, analyzing posts to infer attributes related to interest, hobbies, people, and places. It creates
a comprehensive view of what users are communicating. Visual Insight could help measure brand perception in social media and enable the development of consistent messages across outlets. Companies
can even use it to find customers going through life events. It’s built to help find the big picture in billions of little ones.</p>

										<h2>What is it?</h2>
										<h3>Two premier scientific research institutions co-creating the future of AI</h3>
										<p>The MIT IBM Watson AI Lab consists of two renowned institutions working to create breakthroughs that accelerate
the growth of AI systems. We focus on four key pillars: the development of core learning and reasoning algorithms; using a mastery of physics to create AI-tailored computational innovations; developing AI applications in particular domains; and harnessing AI to achieve shared prosperity. The lab’s overarching goal is to move AI systems toward more general approaches and more complex problems. Achieving that goal requires exploring how to use AI to harness big data and limited data, testing new materials and architectures for analog AI computation, and exploring the nexus of quantum computing and machine learning. We want to make inroads for AI in healthcare and security – and use AI to achieve broad economic and societal bene ts. We envision future AI systems that can detect and mitigate human biases, that explain how they come to their conclusions, that complement humanity, and that distribute productivity gains across  firms, workers, and consumers.</p>
