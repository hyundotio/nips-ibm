							<h3>Quantum for AI</h3>
							<h2>What is it?</h2>
							<h3>Using quantum computers to accelerate the efficacy and growth of AI in business and society</h3>
							<p>AI has advanced substantially in recent years thanks in part to an explosion
of data. But AI’s potential has been hampered in areas where classical computers are of limited use, like chemistry. We think quantum computers can help. They’re powered by qubits, which use a fundamentally different set of instructions than classical machines, and can run different types of algorithms. These algorithms exploit quantum effects like non-locality, entanglement, superposition, and interference to solve problems exponentially faster than classical machines. Some day, when universal quantum computers contain thousands or millions of qubits, it may be possible to load massive data sets into the machines and create a rich environment for AI to calculate problems currently beyond the realm of consideration. In the short term, we imagine hybrid systems that pair classical computers with a small quantum co-processor to increase the speed of performing certain tasks and to eliminate the bottlenecks in AI’s growth.</p>

							<h3>Using machine learning to predict the presence of psychiatric disorders</h3>
							<p>As with many afflictions, early treatment of psychiatric disorders tends to improve outcomes, but diagnosis is exceedingly dif cult, especially with schizophrenia. There is no reliable test, and spotting differences in brain images is often impossible even for experts. But we think AI can help. In collaboration with the University of Alberta, we used AI and machine-learning algorithms to identify statistical biomarkers, abnormalities
in the brain’s functional networks, and predict instances of schizophrenia in a series of fMRI images with 74 percent accuracy. The research also shows a new capability to predict the severity of speci c symptoms in patients. We believe that AI and machine learning can usher
in an era of computational psychiatry that will help clinicians quickly assess, and therefore treat, schizophrenia.
This groundbreaking work also has the potential to help create new avenues and techniques to diagnose and treat other psychiatric disorders, from depression to post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>

							<h3>IBM Debating Technology</h3>
							<h2>What is it?</h2>
							<h3>Using AI to create persuasive arguments about thorny issues</h3>
							<p>IBM Debating Technology is an AI-powered decision-making tool that absorbs massive sets of data and perspectives to address questions that have no clear answer. It uses natural language processing, machine learning, and knowledge graphs to construct a cogent, persuasive argument about complex issues. For example, “Would stricter gun control laws diminish
mass killings?” or “Should I become a vegetarian?” Unlike search engines, Debating Technology doesn’t reply to a query with a list of documents to read. It absorbs a corpus of data to identify compelling arguments covering various aspects of an issue. This requires
the both the ability to understand
the nuances of natural language and to extract powerful evidence from billions of candidates. Big issues are rarely black and white. Using artificial reasoning, Debating Technology creates a passionate viewpoint while dispassionately explaining the other side of the argument. It has the potential to become a powerful ally to anyone faced with making urgent decisions. We imagine it having broad applicability in policy and business. It could even help find the clearest path forward in a user’s life and career.</p>

							<h3>Moments</h3>
							<h2>What is it?</h2>
							<h3>Building a large-scale data set for recognizing action in videos</h3>
							<p>A lot can happen in a moment: A girl kicks a ball in front of a woman walking a dog while a man reads his book on a bench and birds fly overhead. Humans routinely absorb and process the details of such moments and can effortlessly describe objects (girl, ball, birds, book), setting (park) and actions (kicking, walking, reading, flying). But it’s not so easy for computers. Computer vision researchers have made great strides
in image recognition recently thanks
to breakthroughs in deep learning, increases in computing power, and the creation of massive labeled datasets
– namely ImageNet and Places. We want to do the same for action recognition. In collaboration with MIT, we developed Moments, a large-scale dataset containing 1 million 3-second video snippets manually labeled according to the actions they contain. Moments contains 339 verbs and includes activities performed by various actors. For example, opening. People open doors and books. Dogs open
their mouths. Flowers open petals. We believe Moments will spawn an array of applications in healthcare, automotive, entertainment, and elsewhere. We hope it will foster new research and help to further unlock the promise of AI.</p>

							<h3>MLModelScope</h3>
							<h2>What is it?</h2>
							<h3>A one-stop shop to test machine learning and deep learning models and software</h3>
							<p>New open-source machine learning
and deep learning models, platforms, and hardware system accelerators are cropping up almost every day. These resources can greatly spur innovation – if they can be easily tested and compared. It’s often necessary to follow many pages of documentation to install one ML or
DL framework. Then there’s the arduous process required to download and use a particular model – and the complexity of navigating hardware con gurations and software installations and dependencies. MLModelScope aims to simplify this process by enabling developers, builders, and users to quickly find, test, deploy, and benchmark combinations of models, frameworks and configurations. It’s an open-source platform designed to spur AI innovation. Developers can publish and evaluate ML/DL models. Users can experiment with published models and frameworks. IT architects can profile and benchmark system resource utilization to improve operating efficiency for running ML/DL workloads. Hardware builders can understand system characteristics and bottlenecks to improve designs.</p>

							<h3>Watson Discovery Visual Insight</h3>
							<h2>What is it?</h2>
							<h3>Finding the big picture in billions of pictures</h3>
							<p>Every day billions of videos and images are uploaded to the top five social media sites alone. This massive data flow contains invaluable insights for anyone trying to understand customer sentiment, competitor activity, the eficacy of advertising campaigns, or trends in
the marketplace. Of course the trick is identifying signals in all that visual noise. That’s where Watson Discovery Visual Insight comes in. Visual Insight is built on Watson Discovery Service, which finds patterns in massive amounts of data, whether public or private, structured or unstructured. Discovery uses natural language processing to ingest and normalize data into a common format and sentiment analysis and concept tagging to enrich and index it. Visual Insight takes that process to imagery, analyzing posts to infer attributes related to interest, hobbies, people, and places. It creates
a comprehensive view of what users are communicating. Visual Insight could help measure brand perception in social media and enable the development of consistent messages across outlets. Companies
can even use it to find customers going through life events. It’s built to help find the big picture in billions of little ones.</p>

										<h3>Two of the world’s premier scientific research institutions co-creating the future of AI</h3>
										<p>The MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab consists of two renowned institutions working to create breakthroughs that accelerate the growth and eficacy of AI systems. We focus on four key pillars: the development of core learning and reasoning algorithms; using a mastery of physics to create AI-tailored computational innovations; developing AI applications in particular domains; and harnessing AI to achieve shared prosperity. We want to move AI systems toward more general approaches and more complex problems. We’re exploring how to use AI to harness big data and limited data. We’re testing new materials and architectures for analog
			AI computation, and exploring the nexus of quantum computing and machine learning. We’re making inroads for AI to solve crucial problems in healthcare and security – and we’re committed to using AI to achieve broad economic and societal bene ts. Our goal is to build AI systems that can detect and mitigate human biases, that explain how they come to their conclusions, that complement humanity, and that distribute productivity gains across firrms, workers, and consumers.</p>
